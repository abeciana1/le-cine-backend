<h1 id="why">Why?</h1>
Since the start of the pandemic, like many of us, I found myself with less of a social life. In the early days, when most wouldnâ€™t dare step outside of their homes, people needed to find ways to entertain themselves while in quarantine.
<br />
<br />
Although we have to socially distance, it didn't mean we couldn't expand digital forms of socializing. Thankfully, my friend Russell found this as an opportunity to create a safe escape once a week in the form of the Pandemic Film Club. We have all cultivated a lasting friendship that spans across the country.
<br />
<br />
Films have always been a way to fantasize and escape from reality for a short amount of time. The creation of a film club does not only provide an opportunity for people to watch a film, it allows them to analyze, discuss, and share ideas with other people. For instance, in my friend Russell's Pandemic Film Club, we take turns hosting themed double-features. The preparation and homework each week gives that night's host something to look at, read, and interact with in a creative environment. The discussion questions for the "homework" film forces us to take our minds away from the pandemic and into something constructive. The "watchalong" film is a chance for us to share a movie that can be enjoyed and discussed afterwards.
