<h2>Why?</h2>
Since the start of the pandemic, like many of us, I found myself with less of a social life. In the early days, when most wouldnâ€™t dare step outside of their homes, people needed to find ways to entertain themselves while in quarantine.

Thankfully, my friend Russell found this as an opportunity to create a safe escape once a week in the form of the Pandemic Film Club. We have all cultivated a lasting friendship that spans across the country.
